Paper:
+ Explain CMAB (intro)
+ References to MAB techniques used in communications (intro) -> highlight differences
+ Highlight the contribution of the other similar paper in communications (intro) -> highlight differences and own contribution
+ Explain concepts that are used in RL -> stochastic MAB (intro, ch 3)
+ Explain numerical results in more detail (ch 6)
+ Relate TX-RX selection and RL more obviously (ch 4)
+ Explain better how Algorithm 1 was used i.e. what remains the same for different stochastic MAB methods and what is different
- Check the reward distribution and do necessary changes
